# ✅ Conclusion: Local Network Port Scan Analysis

The Nmap scan of the local network (192.168.1.0/24) revealed several open ports and active services across different devices. Key observations and conclusions include:

## 🔍 Key Takeaways
- **192.168.1.1** (Gateway) is running HTTPS on port 443 — expected behavior.
- **192.168.1.5** is hosting multiple services (HTTP, AJP13, HTTPS-ALT) — may indicate a development or testing server.
- **192.168.1.10** (local machine) has several Microsoft networking ports open — common in Windows systems but potentially risky.
- **Unknown services** detected on ports like 6464 and 49152 need further investigation to ensure they are not misconfigured or malicious.

## 🔐 Security Implications
- Several **high-risk ports** (135, 139, 445, 8009) are open. These are common targets for malware and remote attacks.
- **Filtered and inactive devices** help reduce the attack surface, but **every exposed port increases risk**.

## 📌 Final Recommendations
- Audit all open ports and verify if the associated services are required.
- Disable or firewall unnecessary ports on both the router and devices.
- Regularly update software/firmware and apply security patches.
- Use strong credentials, enable encryption where possible, and consider using network segmentation for sensitive devices.

This assessment serves as a foundational step in improving local network security posture. Ongoing monitoring and periodic scans are recommended.
