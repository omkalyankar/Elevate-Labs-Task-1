## üîê Potential Security Risks

- **Port 445 & 139 (SMB, NetBIOS):** Common targets for malware and ransomware attacks.
- **Port 135 (MSRPC):** Vulnerable if exposed; allows remote services to be executed.
- **Port 8009 (AJP13):** If misconfigured, could be exploited for remote code execution (e.g., Ghostcat vulnerability).
- **Unknown ports (6464, 49152):** May be custom services; need to verify if they are legitimate and secured.
- **iPhone-sync (62078):** Normally safe, but unnecessary open ports on personal devices can expose data if intercepted.

## ‚úÖ Final Recommendation

- Disable unnecessary services.
- Close unused ports via firewall/router settings.
- Keep all systems updated and apply security patches regularly.
- Use strong passwords and enable authentication where possible.
